# Eco experiment

Measures economy mode and subagent roles on real and replayed work. Start with the
[plan](plan.md). This branch never merges into `main`.

## Status

| Stage | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S0 | done 2026-10-11 | plan, briefs, baseline, harness, arms, roles; self-tests in [results/S0.md](results/S0.md) |
| S1 | next | on the new PC |
| S2-S5 | waiting | see the plan |

## Next action

On the new PC: follow [setup](setup-new-pc.md), then run the S1 self-test and pilot described
there, and record the results in `results/S1.md`.

## Layout

- [plan.md](plan.md): goals, hypotheses, arms, stages, metrics, decision rules, safety.
- [baseline.md](baseline.md): aggregated metrics from the owner's past sessions.
- [judge.md](judge.md): the blind pairwise judge.
- [setup-new-pc.md](setup-new-pc.md): environment checklist and the S1 procedure.
- `tasks/`: run briefs. Real tasks carry the owner's answers, so runs need no questions.
- `arms/`: prompt additions and agent definitions per arm.
- `tools/`: the harness (`Start-Run.ps1`) and the metrics parser (`Measure-Run.ps1`).
- `results/`: committed aggregates per stage. Raw data stays under `C:\aiu-exp`.

## Operator rules

The operator is the interactive Claude Code session on the new PC that runs the harness.

- Run one run at a time, in the background, and wait for its completion notice.
- Switch subscription accounts only between runs, and keep compared runs on one account
  ([plan](plan.md#accounts)).
- Record `/usage` (ask the owner for the number if the CLI cannot show it) before and after
  each stage in that stage's results file.
- Commit results to this branch and push `origin/exp/eco-roles` after each stage.
- The operator's own tokens are overhead, recorded separately, never added to an arm.
