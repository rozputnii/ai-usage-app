# Eco experiment

Measures economy mode and subagent roles on real and replayed work. Start with the
[plan](plan.md). This branch never merges into `main`.

## Status

| Stage | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S0 | done 2026-10-11 | plan, briefs, baseline, harness, arms, roles; self-tests in [results/S0.md](results/S0.md) |
| S4-local | done 2026-10-11 | [installed-app log digest](results/S4-local-log-digest.md); nothing else needs the current PC |
| S1 | done 2026-10-11 | new PC, account `second`: self-tests, calibration, pilot in [results/S1.md](results/S1.md) |
| S2 | running | owner's go 2026-10-11; partial results in [results/S2.md](results/S2.md) |
| S3-S5 | waiting | see the plan |

## Next action

Continue S2 in batches of at most $20 (`tools/Start-Batch.ps1`): exploration (all six scout variants,
including graphify), then review, then implementation. Before each batch check the owner's latest
session and weekly `/usage` reading: a five-hour window holds about $26 of opus spend
([S1 calibration](results/S1.md#calibration)). Re-measure dollars per weekly percent over S2.

## Layout

- [plan.md](plan.md): goals, hypotheses, arms, stages, metrics, decision rules, safety.
- [baseline.md](baseline.md): aggregated metrics from the owner's past sessions.
- [judge.md](judge.md): the blind pairwise judge.
- [setup-new-pc.md](setup-new-pc.md): environment checklist and the S1 procedure.
- `tasks/`: run briefs. Real tasks carry the owner's answers, so runs need no questions.
- `arms/`: prompt additions and agent definitions per arm.
- `tools/`: the harness (`Start-Run.ps1`) and the metrics parser (`Measure-Run.ps1`).
- `results/`: committed aggregates per stage. Raw data stays under `C:\aiu-exp`.

## Operator rules

The operator is the interactive Claude Code session on the new PC that runs the harness.

- Run one run at a time, in the background, and wait for its completion notice.
- Switch subscription accounts only between runs, and keep compared runs on one account
  ([plan](plan.md#accounts)).
- Record `/usage` (ask the owner for the number if the CLI cannot show it) before and after
  each stage in that stage's results file.
- Commit results to this branch and push `origin/exp/eco-roles` after each stage.
- The operator's own tokens are overhead, recorded separately, never added to an arm.
